I want to write a game in Rust. The game should be similar to Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress. The idea is to have automated drones that get tasks as plain text. They will mine stone and iron. And a player will be able to build some defences with it. Then it will be a tower defence aganst waves of enemies or just one on one battles against another fortress. I want to have a simple 2d ui, but with multiple levels like in minecraft and dwarf fortress. I want to have text commands converted to programs that are used by drones.
